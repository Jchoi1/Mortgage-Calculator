Take-Aways
  Learned a lot about clean code and refactoring your code so that you make your program have less duplicate variables and overall easier to follow along as you read through the code. Also a good practice with classes and functions where i can make different outputs with different parameters but with the same overall code. Overall a useful proeject made in java which I learned and practiced a lot of different topics.
